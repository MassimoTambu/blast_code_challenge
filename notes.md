# NOTES

Some notes about how to structure the models and a list of analysis I want to do

## Models

### Event

Every log line starting with date and time we'll be classified as "Event"
Regex: `^(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{4}) - (\d{2}):(\d{2}):(\d{2})`

### Player

Starts with `"name<id><steamID><team>"` Action or `"name<id><BOT><team>"` Action
Regex: `^\d{2}\/\d{2}\/\d{4} - \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}: "(.*?)<(\d*)><(.*?)><(.*?)>"`


### Action

Starts with Player model
