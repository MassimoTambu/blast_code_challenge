# NOTES

Some notes about how to structure the models and a list of analysis I want to do

## Models

### Event

Every log line starting with date and time we'll be classified as "Event"


### Player

Starts with `"name<id><steamID><team>"` Action or `"name<id><BOT><team>"` Action


### Action

Starts with Player model
